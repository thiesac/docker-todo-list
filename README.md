## Features

- Containerized full-stack Todo List application.
- Docker-compose for orchestration.
- Simplified setup and management.

## Technologies

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Docker: [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thiesac/docker-todo-list.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd docker-todo-list
   ```

## Usage

### Running Docker Commands

The project includes a series of Docker commands, each related to a specific requirement. These commands are organized in the `docker-commands` directory, with each file named `commandN.dc`, where `N` is the requirement number. For example:

Requirement 1: `./docker/docker-commands/command01.dc`
Requirement 2: `./docker/docker-commands/command02.dc`
...

You can execute these Docker commands to perform various tasks related to containers.

### Building Docker Images

The `docker` directory in the project root contains essential files for building Docker images and orchestrating the Todo List application. To build Docker images, follow these steps:

9. Build the Docker image for the Todo List backend application and name it `todobackend`. Execute the following command:

   ```bash
   docker build -t todobackend ./docker/todo-app/back-end
   ```

   In the `./docker/todo-app/back-end/Dockerfile`, you'll find instructions for:

   - Using the Node.js version 16 Alpine base image.
   - Exposing port 3001.
   - Setting the working directory to `/app/back-end`.
   - Adding the `node_modules.tar.gz` file to the image.
   - Copying all files from the `back-end` folder to the image.
   - Starting the application with `npm start`.

   You can run containers based on this image, and the `npm` command will be executed by default. You can also override the `npm start` command if needed.

For additional Docker commands and instructions, please refer to the respective `commandN.dc` files and the project structure.

## Project Structure

The project structure consists of the following main components:

- `docker-commands/`: Contains Docker command files for various requirements.
- `docker/todo-app/`: The directory of the Todo List application.
  - `back-end/`: Contains the backend application and its Dockerfile.
  - Other components related to the application.
